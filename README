ABOUT VAPP and MAPP:

    VAPP is the Berkeley Verilog-A Parser and Preprocessor. VAPP is distributed
    as part of MAPP, the Berkeley Model and Algorithm Prototyping Platform. For
    more information about MAPP, type "help MAPP" in a MATLAB prompt.

    VAPP enables its users to import Verilog-A models into MAPP. To this end,
    Verilog-A files are translated into the ModSpec format which is the native
    model specification format of MAPP. ModSpec is a general model
    specification format, i.e., not just for electrical devices, and supports a
    wider variety of tools for defining device models than Verilog-A does.
    Since MAPP's emphasis is on electrical devices and circuits, ModSpec offers
    convenient ways of dealing with voltages and currents. However, this
    feature is designed with good modeling practices in mind. In order to
    encourage model developers to observe these principles, MAPP's interface
    for electrical quantities only supports a subset of the Verilog-A language.
    For more information about ModSpec, type "help ModSpec" in a MATLAB prompt.

USAGE:

    (In the following block of text, the characters ">>" indicate a MATLAB
    prompt.)

    To start using VAPP, first setup paths by running

        >> start_MAPP

    from the top-level VAPP directory and type

        >> help va2modspec

    to obtain information about VAPP's simple user interface.

IMMEDIATE:
* start_VAPP
* LICENSE
* Visitor for discovering which extra voltages don't need to be internal_unks
* Visitor for semantic checks
* Visitor for determining which IOs in an implicit equation are variables
* See the negative capacitance example -> set current to zero if not given
* Detect that the source for a branch is zero and tell ModSpec so.
* inout statement from the frontend is missing
* support for multiple function outputs in function calls (not definitions).
  => hard one.

LONG TERM:
* Clarify the issue with multiple outs to the visit methods

NOTES:
Possible bug in MAPP:
a branch with no voltage and no current contribution is not automatically
assumed to be a open branch

DOCUMENTATION:
rules for writing down ddt(...) expressions.
    fail cases: two ddt's in a single expression
    use ddt only in contrib statements, i.e., not with variables
    ddt must have a path to the top, i.e., ddt -> contribution must lie on
    ddtPath
    division by ddt -> currently executes but is illegal

APPLICATION:
translate: R3, bsim4, psp models
